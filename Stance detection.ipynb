      "Madam President! Dear colleagues! A few weeks ago I was allowed to accompany the Foreign Minister on her trip to Mali and Niger. My colleagues there have heard one thing over and over again: security; we need security. From the director in Bamako: Security. From the writer: Security. From the civil society activist in Gao: Security. – The women I was allowed to meet want and need security when doing their job, when shopping, on the way to the well. We have been discussing here in this House for weeks, months, that security is not just a military concept. But if the women I've met in Gao, among other places, have made one thing clear, it's this: it's hard to feel safe when the world around you is dominated by terror and organized crime. Restoring the security of women, men, children, of all people in Mali, that is in our interest. And that is the mandate that we want to give the Bundeswehr for the UN mission MINUSMA. Our commitment should continue to contribute to the stabilization of the country. We want to help keep the peace and protect human rights. We are not doing this uncritically to protect the Malian government. We condemn the military coup. The transition process towards a democratic order must continue. But in my conversations with people in Mali, it has become clear that democratic elections and criticism of the military coup are not high on their agenda. That is and remains security for the time being. We hear that and we take it seriously. Therefore, the most important German mission in Mali is the implementation of the peace agreement and the protection of human rights. Our soldiers, to whom we owe a great deal of thanks, support compliance with the ceasefire. We promote confidence-building measures and help restore state integrity. In a country plagued by terror and organized violence, which is extremely fragile, these state structures are needed all the more. In this way, the UN mission intends to deprive criminal and terrorist networks in the region of their breeding ground. In this way we create important space for the work of civilian personnel, for UN personnel, for humanitarian aid that urgently needs to get to where it is needed. That, dear colleagues, is the basic idea of ​​this mission. This mandate is a sign of new responsibility, a response to geostrategic challenges. When the French troops withdraw from Mali in late summer, we will be the largest provider of troops from the Global North there. With 300 new soldiers, we are closing the gap left by the French, especially in the rescue chain and in airport operations. We have the needed transport helicopters and the needed drones. These are practically irreplaceable when implementing the mandate. Of course, growing up also means an enormously increased responsibility. We wear these for the people in Mali, but also for our soldiers. What we don't have - that's part of being honest - are attack helicopters, and they will be missing when the French withdraw. That carries risks; because without close air support, our soldiers are exposed to greater danger. This is precisely why the Federal Government is in close contact with our partners in order to replace these skills; This is the only way we can guarantee protection throughout. And that's also why we have an exit clause in the mandate: to enable a full withdrawal if the security situation no longer allows anything else. Of course, a German contribution to MINUSMA must also be seen in the context of the other actors in Mali. We know that Russian forces of the \"Group Wagner\" are on site. We know that they are committing serious human rights abuses and that the military junta is working with them. We also know that this cooperation has increased. We cannot and will not accept the targeted Russian disinformation campaigns that attempt to frame our French partners for war crimes. This is one of the reasons why we should do everything we can to ensure that we do not give way now. It is important for the world community to stabilize the countries in the Sahel and not leave them to Russian propaganda. Mali's government is getting caught up in Russian geostrategic calculations. Ultimately, civil society will suffer as a result. The Foreign Minister also made that clear on our trip. Coming back to civil society, I want to speak up for the women of Gao, the people of Mali who are living in insecurity right now. Because only - and that's what it's all about in the end - can stability for democratic elections develop out of security, only out of security can itself develop freedom. If we can contribute to this, then we should do so, and we can do so through the Bundeswehr's participation in MINUSMA. That is why, dear colleagues, I recommend supporting this mandate. Next speaker: for the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, Johann Wadephul.\n",

      "Madam President! My dear colleagues! The CDU/CSU parliamentary group supports this mandate - as in the past, so now. We have a responsibility for this region, which is maltreated, suffering from overpopulation, malnutrition, terrorism. Europe and Germany have a responsibility for the Sahel region. We perceive this. That is why the CDU/CSU parliamentary group supports the federal government's motion and will vote in favor today. We also support the United Nations. In this global political situation - we are discussing many other regions of the world in the committees and of course also here in the plenary session of the German Bundestag - the United Nations would have to be invented if it did not already exist. That is why every mission that we are currently doing within the framework of the United Nations is a particularly valuable one. Every effort by Germany to strengthen the United Nations is worth it. There are enough nations that want to weaken the United Nations, that want to undermine it, that want to set up their own rules. That's not our policy. We are committed to the international, rule-based order. This mission manifests that, and that is why it is good if there is a broad majority in the German Bundestag for continuing this mission in Mali and in the Sahel zone, dear colleagues. I do, however, have a few comments on the process and the content of our commitment to the future. One concerns the procedure; I would like to say that to my colleagues - Ms Haßelmann, we worked together for some time in the first committee - again in all seriousness. We received the mandate text two hours before the first reading. We have not been able in the working groups of our group as a whole to provide information before the committee deliberations on how this mandate should go ahead and under what circumstances. You all know that the committee debate is crucial for us to inform all parliamentary group colleagues about the prevailing circumstances under which the federal government intends to continue the mission. The Bundestag Participation Act is not a Bundestag Disclosure Act. We expect the coalition to deal with Parliament differently in future. I assume that your colleagues are also interested in being properly informed. I think something like this shouldn't happen again in the future. You could gossip and it wouldn't betray the coalition, if you might even share it; I saw a little nod in your ranks. The second thing is - I would also like to say this in all seriousness -: Ms. Spellerberg, I can almost fully agree with your comments. That is very gratifying, and we are happy to do so. You briefly mentioned the opt-out clause, which we deepened in the Defense Committee. I would like to say it again: we need to know what this is about. The defense minister said in committee that a complete withdrawal of our forces is possible if there is no guarantee of replacing the forces that the French are now providing. At the same time, we were given the signal that the French forces are expected to withdraw around August. Ladies and gentlemen, are we seriously talking today about a mandate that the federal government intends to end completely as early as August? Do you seriously want to withdraw more than 1,000 soldiers from this UN mission - I said something to the UN - in August, leave the UN head over heels - Madam Colleague, you pointed this out - without these important reconnaissance forces, so to speak? I can only say: That is an adventurous idea. Mrs Lambrecht, what you said about this in the Defense Committee shows once again that the advice our parliamentary group leader gave to the Federal Chancellor was more than appropriate. That's not how it works! Either we agree to a mandate here in which the United Nations can rely on German forces of this strength, as the strongest mandated force on the ground, being reliably on site for a year, or we do not agree to the mandate. We must be able to rely on the federal government doing everything it can to ensure that the mandate can be observed. This is your homework; we'll give you that. – That is not an exciting construct, Mr Lechte. I want to say this in all seriousness: it has been known since February that the French are definitely withdrawing. Those who, like you, are well informed about the whole situation on the ground and the relationship between the Malian government and the French government could have assumed beforehand that this would happen. Well, this ain't a thing that fell from the sky and it would have been the Secretary of Defense's job to take care of that. We have to use the time now. For my group, I offer cooperation and discussion in the technical committees over the next few months. We now need a strategy for this region. The trilemma has been correctly described. Ms Spellerberg, I share that: of course we must continue to create the security policy prerequisites so that democratic development, social development can take place in this region, especially in the state of Mali, so that women, but also all other people, can move around safely. For this we need an expanded concept of security; that is perfectly clear. Of course we must not allow the Russians to gain influence with \"Wagner\" forces, and of course we must fight international terrorism. This requires an overall strategy, which has so far been lacking. That's what we should all strive for. Thank you for your attention. Next speaker: Nils Schmid for the SPD parliamentary group.\n",

      "Madam President! Ladies and gentlemen! First of all, I am grateful to the CDU/CSU parliamentary group for supporting this mission. It is good that we have the broadest possible support from within the House on the question of where the Bundeswehr is to be sent abroad. However, I am somewhat surprised, Mr Wadephul, at your statement on the mandate and the question of a possible withdrawal of the Bundeswehr. On the other hand, you, as the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, don't seriously want to continue the mission if the safety and medical care of our soldiers can no longer be guaranteed. This is not about an abstract commitment to a UN mission. Of course, this federal government, like the previous federal governments, wants to strengthen the work of the UN and in particular to provide support for one of the largest peace missions of the UN. But if our soldiers are in danger because medical care can no longer be adequately guaranteed in the event of a crisis due to a lack of transport capacities, then we have to take action. That is our responsibility as parliamentarians for our Bundeswehr. That is why there is this opt-out clause in the mandate, as presented by the federal government, and we are expressly committed to having to withdraw the Bundeswehr soldiers if their safety can no longer be guaranteed. But I also want to make it clear that the Mali mission once again shows the close connection between security and development: without security there is no development; without development, but also no sustainable security. – This is why this deployment of the Bundeswehr in Mali has been a test case for the networked approach for years; because the conflict situations, the problem situations in Mali are manifold: Above all, there are social conflicts over distribution, exacerbated by the change in the climate in the Sahel zone as a whole, there are economic conflicts, and there are unresolved political conflicts. In addition, there is above all the lack of representation of the younger generation in the political system, reinforced by political mistakes in recent years: that in Mali, too, the government has relied on the deployment of militias in the past, who have also been accused of serious human rights violations, that now the \"Wagner\" militia - also accused of serious human rights violations - that elections are not held and that, when they are held, they do not meet with sufficient acceptance because not all population groups are represented. Demilitarization and reintegration of armed combatants is progressing slowly. The civil push promised at the N'Djamena summit in terms of creating islands of stability is also proceeding very hesitantly and sluggishly. So there is a very difficult overall situation, but where this mission, MINUSMA, performs central stabilization functions. It is therefore good that we are doing two things today in the German Bundestag: where things are not going well, namely with EUTM, with the training mission, we have the courage to make a clear cut, and not to wait any longer, but to make this cut to do now that the putschists have removed the basis for cooperation. At the same time, we are committed to the work of the United Nations, to the stabilization work for MINUSMA, to supporting the Algiers peace agreement and, of course, to securing the considerable German development aid that is to continue to be guaranteed in Mali. In this respect, MINUSMA is a mission for us that does the right thing in terms of the networked approach. We are also prepared to close capability gaps, provided that the Bundeswehr itself can contribute additional capabilities. But it's a UN mission. It is therefore the responsibility of the entire UN to send sufficient technical capabilities to this mission. It is not the task of the Bundeswehr - it cannot do that - to close all the gaps that have been lamented for years, but that is a task of the international community. In this sense, the federal government is also in talks to close capability gaps such as with transport helicopters. We know that the process in Mali will be arduous. But without elections - a sufficiently solid voter registration in advance is a prerequisite - which also give new forces the opportunity to participate in this democratic process, and without a minimum of democratic institutions in Mali, we will not solve the underlying economic and social conflicts be able. It is very important for me to point out that the approach we are taking in Mali is not hopeless; because Mali has also experienced long periods of democratic government. There is a living one Civil society and institutions that can be further developed, that can be counted on. That is why it is worth every effort - from us in the German Bundestag, the Federal Government, the Bundeswehr, but also from civil commitment - to continue to provide this support for this country via MINUSMA. I would like to thank all those in the Bundeswehr and those working in development aid who continue to work in this country. Of course, the SPD will agree. Thank you very much. Next speaker: for the AfD parliamentary group Jan Nolte.\n",

      "Madam President! Dear Colleagues! This attempt at the latent accusation that we carelessly send soldiers on missions is bottomless cheek, because we have been discussing it for weeks and months. The reason why we presented the mandate so late was that we were struggling to bring the best variant to all of you here in this House, because this mandate is so difficult. – The worst variant is that you were even elected to this House. But unfortunately we have to live with that. I would like to reply to Mr Wadephul: I know it is a very, very difficult process to find one's role in the opposition. I am very grateful that the Union is again agreeing to this mandate today and that we are cooperating and finding common solutions in many, many aspects that we currently have to deal with, including abroad, see the Ukraine application, see the mandates that our Bundeswehr affect. The safety of the soldiers is particularly important to us. We know what's happening down there. That is why we have created all the options in this mandate that we can also order a withdrawal. We have given the federal government the opportunity to do so, depending on how the situation for our soldiers in Mali develops. That's why the mandate is designed that way. You also know that our Bundeswehr lacks certain components that it currently does not have in sufficient quantities, such as combat helicopters. We have more of them - that's well known - namely more than 50 - thank you, Mr. Brandner, for the heckling; I know it myself -; but there are currently only 9 operational. I mean, I have to acknowledge that for 16 years, unfortunately, responsibility for the Bundeswehr lay with the Union. That's just a historical and political fact. We now have to deal with getting everything going, as the Federal Chancellor also said. We need to make things float, we need to make things fly, we need ammo. A coalition that includes the Greens, with their large peace share, and the SPD. - You couldn't do it. - We as the FDP support that, of course. That is why we also need your approval for the 100 billion euros. Which surprise! That's why we can forget all the political discussions here in this House if we don't face up to reality. The reality is that we have an aggressor on the east flank, as it's so nicely called these days. In order to counter this, we have to fight together and omit the comments for once. I'm looking forward to the speech that's coming up. I hope that the colleague from the SPD will then be able to have breakfast accordingly. Today we are discussing MINUSMA as the German Bundeswehr's most important mission abroad until recently. In Mali there are not only \"Wagner\" mercenaries from Russia, but there are also official Russian troops. But if we had now said: \"We're going out there,\" then Russia could have sent 100, 200, 300 soldiers to any crisis area without any problems. As a result, the West would have shied away from its responsibility. We're not allowed to do that. So that it is also said here in the House: next to the French, who have problems with the Malian government - the Malian government is really not easy; I was there when the Foreign Minister discussed and spoke with President Goϊta - we are not the only country on God's globe, as one might sometimes think from the statements in this House, which provides troops there. There are many smaller troop contributors there who participate in this mandate and who rely on us. These include Belgium, Estonia, Lithuania and the Netherlands as our local European partners, but also large troop providers such as Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Niger, Senegal, Togo and the Ivory Coast - multinational. And they all rely on the great German contingent, on the skills we have down there, and on us working with them to keep it safe. I already said in the last debate that there are now over 30,000 more people in Gao than at the start of the conflict. These people trust that we are there. However, if at the end of the day it no longer works and the basis for the safety of our soldiers is not in place, then this mandate gives the Federal Government the opportunity to withdraw. At the same time, we wrote in the mandate that the Bundestag would receive a report from the Federal Government at any time if we so wished. So, in addition to the evaluation, we also have another another component: the reports for us parliamentarians. That's why I'm asking for your approval. A better and more diversified mandate has not been presented to this House for a long time. Many Thanks. Next speaker: for the faction The Left Ali Al-Dailami.\n"

      "Dear Madam President! Dear colleagues! Ladies and gentlemen! Let me make it very clear right from the start: Yes, we as members of parliament bear a great deal of responsibility for the well-being of our soldiers, whom I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank for their commitment. And many thanks to my colleague Lechte for his patience as a tutor for the right side of the house. I thought I'd have to do that for the left side; now I have to do it a bit for Mr. Hahn as well. Mr. Hahn, it is a UN mandate and we operate within an international framework. And if you had paid close attention, you would know that it is either in the mandate text or in the coalition agreement where we have undertaken the evaluation. We deal with this responsibility very, very sensibly. That is why I would also like to expressly thank the Federal Government for the fact that all the suggestions from the intensive consultations of the last few weeks and months have now flowed into this mandate text, which we are voting on today. As a result, the protection of soldiers is also given the necessary consideration. As already mentioned, the MINUSMA mission has several pillars. The peace treaty of Algiers is to be secured. This peace was and is fragile, yes, and yet this peace treaty is the basic framework for peaceful coexistence. It is better to protect a fragile peace than risk a hot war. Second, MINUSMA is intended to protect the civilian population. Protecting the life and limb of children, women and men and enabling them to live without fear through the presence of international forces is a self-explanatory goal. Most of us don't know from personal experience what it's like to have to live in an unsafe crisis area. We live in safety. But what we can do, indeed must do, is to guarantee the people in the Sahel a little more security and freedom from fear. The international presence in the country is warmly welcomed by the local population. MINUSMA enjoys high approval in the regions where the mission is active. Third. Yes, MINUSMA - and that has already been mentioned - is also a guarantee for securing development cooperation and thus for the future in the Sahel. We all know that people need prospects for the future. Germany is a welcome and reliable partner. Minister Svenja Schulze's house coordinates numerous important initiatives in Mali. And many of these initiatives, yes, many important projects, are simply not feasible without a minimum level of security - and Mrs. Spellerberg mentioned this -. With our promised participation in MINUSMA, we ensure that these valuable projects are continued. But we are also showing the international community that Germany is prepared to assume responsibility within the framework of the UN. And here is the desired announcement to the far left of the House: International responsibility does not mean that the UN is accused of a war effort. By raising the upper limit for personnel, we are supporting the compensation of skills previously taken over from France, especially in the area of ​​medical facilities. Do you call that warlike, Mr. Al-Dailami? What world are you living in? Do you really think that's the reality? I'm glad my reality looks different. But we also formulate conditions for the UN in the interests of our soldiers; and this exit clause has already been mentioned several times. So that the citizens also know what we are talking about, I would like to quote briefly: If a sufficient level of protection for German soldiers can no longer be guaranteed during the term of the mandate, measures must be taken to adjust the German contribution up to and including the end of the mission . This concerns in particular the continued availability of close air support after the withdrawal of the French attack helicopters. I am very grateful to Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht for once again making it very clear in committee how important this point is to her. In many talks, she tried to find a solution with other nations and will continue to get involved there. But - and our colleagues from the Union should also know this - ensuring that close air support is part of the mission is not the original task of the German Defense Minister, but the task of the United Nations. We are showing the United Nations that we are ready to take responsibility. But we also draw a clear line to protect our soldiers. We formulate a clear mandate for the UN. I assume so, sir dr Wadephul that we agree on that. You talked about the UN. The UN is definitely not perfect. But it is the best multinational conflict resolution tool we have, and it is up to individual nations to improve the UN. By approving the amended MINUSMA mandate, let us signal that Germany is prepared to do its part to strengthen international cooperation. Thank you very much.\n",

      "Dear Madam President! Dear Colleagues! Everyone wants and should move safely in everyday life and be able to rely on security forces. That's why the idea of ​​getting smart security sector reforms off the ground, especially in barely functioning states, is fundamentally correct. This was also the background to the European training mission for the Malian military that began in 2013. However, security sector reform must always be more than just training the police or military. Good governance, the rule of law and political control are essential. Unfortunately, not enough has happened here for years. Instead, the corrupt previous government in Mali gambled away people's trust. As a result of growing dissatisfaction, the military junta came to power via a coup, canceled elections and, despite numerous negotiations, threats and sanctions, does not think about sticking to the agreed transitional roadmap to democracy. At the same time, she works with Russian mercenaries and troops, whose primary goals are certainly not human rights, peace and security for the people of Mali. At the end of March, a massacre involving Malian and probably Russian troops took place in the small town of Moura in the southern Mopti region. The United Nations speaks of 500 dead, mostly civilians. Until now, UN investigators have not been given access to Moura. This is totally unacceptable. The incidents must be relentlessly cleared up and those responsible held accountable! The presence of Russian mercenaries is apparently part of a Russian strategy to expand its influence in Africa. But our conclusion can't be that we just flee if a Russian mercenary shows up somewhere. But a military junta that cooperates so closely with Russian troops and mercenaries, refuses reforms and repeatedly disregards human rights and thus de facto completely calls into question the basis of our cooperation in recent years, we cannot, will and must not continue to support them. Therefore, with this mandate, the training ends; a sequel would be irresponsible. At the same time, we will keep up the pressure on the Malian military junta to continue the agreed peace process and finally make progress on the road to democracy. A few soldiers are staying in Bamako for this purpose and to get a picture of the situation on the ground. Chad no longer appears in the mandate and operational area, in contrast to previous years. This is a country where the human rights situation is terrible and which is even further away from democracy than Mali. Dear Colleagues, Our commitment in Niger, where we are not only continuing the training of the special forces as planned and will be completed in the next few months, should be evaluated in a completely different way. Rather, we want to continue to consult with each other afterwards about what needs they see themselves and how we can support them. This makes it clear once again: not all training is the same. Excluding Chad and immediately halting the training of the Malian military is the right thing to do, but it is also right to press ahead with real and effective security sector reform in Niger. Ladies and gentlemen, the very voices that have rightly pointed out the weaknesses of the missions in Mali in the past are warning us today against a complete withdrawal. Rather, we must now finally seize the opportunity and also learn from the mistakes of the past. Mali is one of the poorest countries in the world. Like many others in the Sahel, it is suffering particularly from the effects of the climate catastrophe and has been experiencing a constant security crisis for years. Civil society plays an extremely important role here. Women and young people in particular are courageously standing up for change there. We need to support them more. In the future, we must also look at the local level in particular to see where there are perspectives and potential that we see too little, and where there are negotiating approaches that we need to support much more strongly. For these reasons, too, in the previous debate we called for not only not ending the United Nations mission, but even slightly strengthening it. This is also a very important contribution here in the overall approach. My sincere thanks go to the soldiers of the Bundeswehr and the many civilian experts who are working in Mali under very difficult conditions for a better future for the country. But we also owe it to them that we critically and relentlessly examine the mandates. Many goes in the From my point of view, the comparison with Afghanistan in the Mali debate was said far too easily. I always think a lot about the end of mandates - even more so since the withdrawal from Afghanistan -: When did a mission finally fail? When is it better to leave than to stay? How does a responsible deduction work, and what are the consequences of the vacuum we leave behind? As a coalition, we have to give mandates to answer these difficult questions. We must not ignore the dilemmas or play them down, as has happened again and again in the past, but we must name and respond to the difficulties and areas of tension. A value-led and active foreign policy does not just muddle through and wait and see what others do and then half-heartedly join in. Instead, it requires that we move forward together and proactively with our partners, make decisions and communicate them transparently. We are therefore adapting our commitment to the changed reality in Mali and will continue to assume responsibility in the Sahel region. We are not giving up the field to Russia, but we are sending a clear response to the presence of Russian mercenaries. We are largely ending cooperation with the military junta, but increasing our support for civil society and the United Nations. I am asking for your support for this proposal and thus for approval of the mandate. Many Thanks. Next speaker: for the CDU/CSU parliamentary group Annette Widmann-Mauz.\n",

      "Madam President! Dear Colleagues! Let me make it very clear right from the start: we cannot be satisfied with the situation in Mali and the Sahel. The decision we have to make today is therefore difficult and complex. That's why we as a Union don't make it easy for ourselves. After another military coup in May last year, there is no sign of a quick return to democracy and a constitution in Mali. On the contrary: the Malian government is delaying the transition to a government legitimized by elections. She works with Russia and the so-called \"Wagner\" mercenaries who are suspected - we've heard - of being responsible for the most serious human rights abuses in Moura. The interim government blocked their investigation. It hinders the work of international missions on the ground, for example by arbitrarily denying Western troop contributors flight rights for reconnaissance, surveillance and supplies. Finally, just a few days ago, the regime of interim President Goïta announced Mali's withdrawal from the group of G‑5 Sahel states and is now accusing the West of having been involved in an alleged military coup. Mali has been going its own way for some time. The regime is redefining its alliances and is increasingly confronting France and the West. During the joint trip with the Federal Foreign Minister and her conversation with Goïta, it became clear that Mali relies on Russia when it comes to security and that Russia's illegal attack on Ukraine and Putin's criminal war are not stopping it. Mali's abstention in the vote in the UN General Assembly once again underscores this attitude. So there are legitimate doubts as to whether there is still a common basis and a shared understanding of cooperation with the EU and with us in Mali. It is therefore logical, yes, it is consistent, to make our military engagement in Mali conditional. This means: the door is not finally slammed shut. Firstly, that would only play into the hands of Russia, which discredits our Western values ​​there and exploits the vacuum of weak and corrupt states to expand its strategic sphere of influence in Africa. And secondly, it would further fuel system competition on the African continent and promote a split into pro-Western, pro-Russian or pro-Chinese states. Ladies and gentlemen, that clearly cannot be in our interests. On the other hand, with the reservation, one perspective remains open, albeit under clear conditions: Our Bundeswehr cannot and must not train security forces who are also involved in the worst human rights violations. It is therefore just as logical to shift the focus of the EUTM Mali military training mission to the neighboring country of Niger for the time being. Niger has proven to be a reliable partner for Germany and is needed as an anchor of stability for the entire region. After all, our military engagement in the Sahel is primarily about security. Above all, however, it is also about creating the basic prerequisites for statehood and strengthening people's trust in the state order. This is what the networked approach that Germany is pursuing on the ground stands for, which aims not only at security but also at stabilization and development. That's what people rightly expect - be it the amazing young entrepreneurs we met in Bamako, the students at the university in Niamey or the people in Gao and Ouallam who want a life without fear of violence and with prospects. Our soldiers work for them under very dangerous conditions as part of MINUSMA and EUTM Mali. With their important service, they help prevent failing states and combat the causes of flight and displacement. I would like to thank you and - I want to say this very explicitly - also the police officers in the civilian EUCAP missions for this difficult but above all excellent work. With the German special forces operation Gazelle, the Bundeswehr has played a significant role in the development and training of the Nigerien special forces within the framework of EUTM. The new special forces school in Tillia is an expression of this successful cooperation. We were able to experience for ourselves on site how highly valued our German commitment is there. Ladies and gentlemen, there are reasons for that: The German management and safety culture actively involves local staff. Working with the closed, national association helped enormously. And our commitment to education and training acts on an equal footing, together with our partners designed on site and closely aligned to their needs. We can build on that. Although the Nigerien security forces have benefited enormously from international training and equipment support, they are not able to cope with the increasing terrorist threat either quantitatively or qualitatively on their own. There are just eight security forces per 1000 square kilometers of land. The government has set itself the goal of doubling this number by 2025 - a minimal increase, but an enormous effort for Niger. We should support the country to the best of our ability. Our commitment in Niger is therefore a good investment in the security and future of the country and the entire Sahel region, even after Operation Gazelle has ended. For this reason, the Union will agree to the extension of the mandate and the reduction of the military ceiling for Mali. Thank you very much. Next speaker: for the SPD faction Frank Schwabe.\n",

      "Madam President! Dear Madam or Sir! Many colleagues in the German Bundestag have had the opportunity to have been to Mali or Niger and see the situation on the ground. To those who couldn't do that, I recommend the award-winning film \"Timbuktu\" from 2014, which makes it clear once again what hopes the people in the region have, what oppression they are exposed to, how dramatic the situation is for many people in Mali, representatively for the entire Sahel region. This makes it clear how urgently it is necessary for us to get involved there accordingly. Many counter this with the example of Afghanistan and say: It didn't work there either, so it can't work there now either. - I don't think we can think like that, but we have the responsibility to think about it in each individual case - we will work through and discuss Afghanistan - what can we from Germany do in concert with the United Nations to stabilize difficult parts of this world to act? In 2014 - you always have to be aware of this - we were on the verge of jihadists taking over power completely in Mali. That was the moment when France went in with combat troops, when MINUSMA was created and when, at the end, the EUTM Mali training mission, which we are now talking about here, was also launched. We are talking about a region of great instability. Three of the five countries in the Sahel are now being led by a coup government. That's why it's a fine balancing act to do everything we can to prevent the region from sinking further into chaos. But at the same time, of course, we don't want to support a coup government. This is the tightrope walk that also applies to this EUTM mandate. On the one hand, we want to stay and continue training. But on the other hand, we don't want to train the soldiers of a coup government. That is why the focus and concentration on Niger and why the mandate has been reduced from 600 to 300 soldiers. I've been walking past the Defense Committee boardroom for the last few days. There is this memorial for the soldiers. If you take a few minutes and look, you can see how many soldiers from Germany died in Mali. That is why it is necessary for us to fight hard for this mandate, and that is why, Mr Wadephul, I did not understand - you may not even know it yourself; but it's actually a bit below your standards - that you combine this with a criticism of the Secretary of Defense. Of course it is our responsibility to always think about it with every mandate: Is it responsible for the soldiers from Germany? In any case, can we limit the risk to which they are exposed in such a way that we can take responsibility for this mandate? That is why it is of course right that the defense minister and all of us in this House are thinking about it together: What are the requirements for such military operations? And if they are not there, then we will have to end this military operation. But we think it is necessary. That's why we have to explain to the soldiers that we believe that we have to do our part to ensure that the region doesn't sink further into chaos - not Niger, not the other countries of the Sahel, where Islamist groups are up to mischief, where criminal gangs rule , with Niger considered a transit country for arms, drugs and people smuggling, where there is also rapid population growth, scarcity of resources and food insecurity. That is why - and I would complain about that for us, for the colleagues in the coalition - we want to take an integrated approach, that we combine what constitutes development cooperation with what we can do in terms of security policy components want. We provide comprehensive development cooperation throughout the Sahel. We support judicial reforms, we support the fight against corruption, we support efforts to decentralize, to make the police more effective, to resolve local conflicts, to come to terms with the past and to prevent extremism, to name just a few examples. The palette could be continued. So we are active. And so that we can be active there, have a stabilizing effect in terms of development cooperation, it is also necessary to have a military component. This includes training the soldiers of the governments, who are democratically formed there. That is what we are doing with this EUTM Mali mandate. I want to ask for support again. There are two things involved. The first is self-protection the ability of German soldiers to protect themselves. The second is that we do everything we can to make sure we don't support coup governments. That is why Mali is now - at least with small exceptions - not included in this EUTM mandate. Should that change, because we hope to get a democratic government in Mali again, we would come back to it in the German Bundestag and ask for a mandate change. Many many thanks. Before moving on to the next speaker, I come back to agenda item 26. Voting time is almost up. Is there another member in the house who hasn't voted yet? – My colleague Schwabe. - Everything is good. He still has time now. If he moves a little faster, we can close the vote right away. So let's continue the debate for now. Gerold Otten is the next speaker for the AfD parliamentary group.\n"

      "Dear Madam President! Dear Colleagues! Dear soldiers! There is always room for doubt when it comes to sending soldiers on foreign missions. Today is a bit of an emotional day for me to be here in this House deliberating on operations in a country where I have served three times as a soldier. So I know what it's like to arrive in Bamako with a Berghaus backpack and a metal box and spend several months there. It's a momentous decision. Because of this, it is very important that we seriously discuss whether an investment or commitment in a country is justified or not. Many aspects come into play here: security policy and foreign policy considerations. Is our engagement forward-looking, comprehensive and multilateral? Is the protection of the soldiers guaranteed? But also: is it effective or not? We are involved in a variety of ways in Mali, namely in three foreign assignments. We have just voted on the renewed MINUSMA mandate. We are active with EUCAP Sahel, a civilian police mission. And we are also involved with EUTM Mali. What is the purpose of this mission? The task is to strengthen the ability to ensure security in the Sahel, so that the Sahel states can protect their own territorial integrity. And we do that in two ways: since 2013 with the training of Malian armed forces, logistical forces and infantry forces as well as leader training and since 2018 with Operation Gazelle, i.e. special forces training in Niger, which began as a small deployment of combat swimmers in the desert and now deployed there as a national special forces unit. However, when we decide to do something, we also have to ask ourselves: Are we supporting the right people? How do we support? And do we achieve our goals? There we have to say very clearly: Even if, according to a recent study by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, 84 percent of the population feel that the security situation in Mali is better than in the previous year, even if 90 percent of the Malian population support the military government, we can do it with ours not reconcile our foreign policy goals and our values ​​to say: \"We continue to train Malian soldiers\" when they commit human rights violations after their training. Still, it's important to maintain the conversation channel and maintain a small footprint in the Malian General Staff as we shift our focus to Niger, deploying 230 soldiers there to continue special forces training; because this government is an anchor of stability in the region and, despite the difficult framework conditions there, wants to make a contribution to stability in the Sahel as a democratic government. How do we achieve our goals? This is where the deployment in Niger and the special forces training differ from the previous engagement in Mali. After all, we only trained in Mali but did not provide any material, which often meant that soldiers could not continue to be deployed in their function or in the training association after their training, we changed that in Niger. We put infrastructure there. We provide the training. We provide the equipment, train the Nigerien security forces and thus make a sustainable contribution to stabilization in the region. We should always keep in mind that no mandate is without alternatives. This is due to respect and responsibility towards our soldiers who we send into the world and towards their families; because ultimately there is always the risk that soldiers will return wounded in body or soul or even fallen in a metal coffin. It is therefore important that we evaluate this mandate; this is what we have set ourselves as a traffic light coalition. I hope that our national security strategy will make it even easier for us to evaluate based on fixed criteria: is it worth getting involved? Isn't it worth it? How do we achieve this? What did we do? We have reduced the staff approach. We changed the focus; we have removed Chad from the mandate. I think all of this will help ensure that we can now continue to operate successfully in Niger with this approach. In a year's time, when this mandate is due to be reviewed, we can speak again about whether or not we have achieved our goals, and we will adjust accordingly if necessary. Mr. Arlt - I'll hold on for the last few seconds - would you allow one more comment or question from the Die Linke parliamentary group? no – The soldiers can count on us to make responsible decisions. Once again I want to thank all the soldiers who are serving in Mali, who are under do their duty under the most difficult conditions in Mali and Niger and would like to campaign for approval of the mandate. Many Thanks. I shall thus conclude the debate on this item on the agenda.\n",

      "Madam President! Ladies and gentlemen! Dear Colleagues! A home of your own, a city apartment, a small house in the country - that is lived freedom. The Federal Constitutional Court put it very nicely in the words that property is the economic basis for individual freedom. That's the way it is. A home is much more than that. That's a good retirement plan; it ensures independence from rising rents, independence from inflation. It is therefore not surprising that millions of people in our country dream of it; four out of five dream this dream of their own four walls. Unfortunately, the truth is that for far too few people this wish can also be realized. He remains a dream. In Europe, Germany is at the bottom of the list when it comes to homeownership, and this is particularly true for young families and people with low or middle incomes. They all dream this dream; but it all too often bursts because of rising building costs, because there is not enough building land available, and sometimes because of the political framework. Then, knowing that millions of people dream of it, it should actually be an expression of good, citizen-friendly politics, to react to it and to enable these people to really live this dream of their own four walls. But if we now look: \"What is the traffic light doing there?\", then unfortunately one has to state: That is a big empty space that the traffic light has here. If you read the coalition agreement, you can see that there were still noble goals. There were melodious promises that you would like to make equity-replacing loans, lower interest rates and many, many other things that would have been the right way to go. To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised when I read it. But if you now look at the reality: \"What is actually left of it?\", you have to realize: nothing. Nothing remains of these lofty goals and euphonious promises. Because: What is the traffic light doing? There is no separate approach in the household to bring the topics of “ownership”, “promotion of young families” to the fore at this point. On the contrary: we already know that with the Baukindergeld - this is a measure that we as a Union have launched, from which many hundreds of thousands of families have benefited and which is extremely popular - it will probably be the case that many families , who are eligible to apply, ultimately get nothing because the funds are not made available. We had a KfW funding freeze that massively destroyed trust, which deprived young families on the way to their own four walls of the basis for their financing. We see that the building minister, who should actually be the first to bring these measures forward, gets involved in newspaper interviews on this subject and says that the construction of new single-family houses makes no ecological and economic sense. Ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues from the traffic light, I can tell you: these are the completely wrong decisions; these are the wrong signals. We have to do the opposite. We need to bring more people into their own four walls. You're missing out on that with your politics. As a Union, we are addressing this in a paper in which we have worked out nine points that show what the right course would be to make exactly this goal, the dream of your own four walls, possible. The point here is that we get reliable, adequate and sustainable KfW funding off the ground that makes this triad possible: new construction, ownership creation, climate protection. And that also means affordable rents. We will only be able to do that if this subsidy chaos, this back and forth at KfW, finally stops and the people, the builders, have planning and investment security so that they can set out to build new, build affordably, build energy efficient. We won't be able to do that with this attentism that we have now, that all projects will be put on hold because no one knows how things will actually go on. They must finally clarify how the KfW funding will continue! Of course, above all, the ancillary costs must go down. I would like to address the real estate transfer tax in particular. This is a tax that has increased enormously in revenue in recent years. We predict that in 2022 there will be a volume of around 18 billion euros in real estate transfer tax. That's clear: Because the purchase costs and real estate prices are developing in this way, this tax revenue is increasing. This is a huge hurdle, especially for young families. They don't get these additional costs financed; no bank will finance them. Because of this they need capital for it. We all know that people with low and middle incomes and young families lack this equity. That's why we as a Union say: We need family-friendly tax exemptions for owner-occupied homes, so that young people and families can finally live this dream. – Your federal finance minister, who is now federal chancellor, dragged that out in the last electoral term. He didn't deal with the countries. That has to change now. We need these allowances for real estate transfer tax. I would like to mention one last point very briefly. Our primary concern is to finally give many tenants the opportunity to purchase property. That is why we are committed to government-backed hire-purchase models that, over a long period of time, instead of just paying rent, you can pay into your own pocket, into your own wallet, make repayments and ultimately also have the opportunity as a tenant to purchase property. We need a joint effort. I want, we want as a Union, that Germany does not remain a country of dreamers, but becomes a country of owners. Support us in this. We are ready. We presented the right concepts. Therefore: Please support our application. Many Thanks. Next speaker: for the federal government, Federal Minister Klara Geywitz.\n",

      "Madam President! Dear Sir or Madam! Dear Union faction, thank you very much for this application. I think that given the many challenges we are currently facing in the construction sector, it is very good that we are taking the time to talk about how people in this country manage to find affordable housing for themselves, and how we are promoting new construction how we can support the rehabilitation. You can discuss this very calmly and objectively with one another. I'm known for being a rather quiet person. At this point I would like to express an emotion, Dr. Luczak: I don't quite understand why you quote me in such an abbreviated way. They say I have something against building houses because it makes no sense economically and ecologically. That would indeed be somewhat surprising if the building minister had fundamental problems with building. That's why I ask you to read the quote again. It said: It makes no economic and ecological sense for every generation to build their own homes. Honestly, that's not so revolutionary now. I'm not the first person who came up with this idea. In Germany we have had the tradition for centuries that houses are of course passed on from one family to the next. It is clearly desirable to remodel your parents' house, to modernize it. Today, however, many people no longer live in the village where their parents live. This means that if you want to have your own house, you first think: I'll build a new one. - Your parents' old house isn't where you live. We have to address that. We have built thousands of single-family homes since World War II that are now empty of families. These homes will be up for resale sometime soon. We have a huge renovation backlog in this area. The building sector is a major problem in achieving climate targets. And indeed, we have many families who understandably dream of having their own little house with a garden. As a mother of three children, I can understand that very well. But how do we bring these two social poles together: the many existing houses that all need new heating, that need to be insulated, that need to be energetically renovated, and this understandable desire? One very simple thing is a refurbishment grant, so we provide an incentive to get young families thinking about choosing a beautiful existing home and converting it to suit their needs. Dr. Luczak, I was with you in the parliamentary group, in the working group. Thank you for the good discussion there. For example, we talked together about the “Young Buys Old” program you mentioned. This is something that already exists that we would like to strengthen. Even with the BEG - keyword \"renovation funding\" - there is a great incentive to say: Yes, I'll buy. – My goal is that with the ownership promotion models that we will develop – that's a firm commitment; You mentioned the coalition agreement - putting a focus on rehabilitation funding. Another point we will implement is increasing the percentage for straight-line depreciation from 2 to 3 percent. I think you have also noticed that our colleague Christian Lindner is currently talking very intensively with the federal states about how the real estate transfer tax can be developed in the way you indicated, that the federal states are able to use differentiated assessment rates . The fact is that most people only build a house once in their life. And then you can also think about taking a different real estate transfer tax rate. It is important - many of you were present at the construction industry day yesterday - that we now react to the increase in construction costs. Of course, it is not conceivable that we would subsidize all building materials; but we have to think about how we can have a dampening effect on the construction costs in this situation. An important point here is the whole question of modernization of the construction industry. In ten years, construction sites will look different: Fewer skilled workers, more mechanization and more digitization, and we will of course work with different building materials. An important point in cost containment is the whole development towards serial building, towards modular building, towards standardized building. Yes, that looks nice too. Yes, you can also do that with sustainable materials. And no, it doesn't look like it was in the 70s. I invite everyone to approach the federal states on this point in particular. You know that there are 16 different building codes in Germany. If you're really with typed builds If you want to achieve cost savings, then of course it must be possible to build the same type of building from Hamburg to Munich. We will have to talk about this with our colleagues in the countries. I invited them to the Alliance for Affordable Housing. I would be very happy, Dr. Luczak, if I could then also approach you, the Union faction, that we standardize the essential provisions of the building code in Germany in order to relieve the construction industry of unnecessary bureaucracy. Thank you for the reason for the debate. Next speaker: for the AfD parliamentary group Marc Bernhard.\n",

      "Madam President! Ladies and gentlemen! Rents are at the top and trust in government is at the bottom. Six months of traffic light government was enough to thoroughly destroy the dream of many people of their own four walls. In January, the government stopped the KfW funding overnight without any prior warning, one week before the official end, and in doing so stole the homes of many thousands of families, people who had already spent tens of thousands of euros on architectural plans, energy consultants, property purchases , building permits, real estate transfer tax, notary fees, etc. and have relied on your promise of support. Because of this government, many of these people are now in debt of many thousands of euros, with no hope of being able to afford their own four walls. And those who could afford to change the construction plans and energy planning for many thousands more euros so that they correspond to your new funding program according to the KfW‑40 standard are now finally devastated by their new funding promise just stopped for three hours without any warning. So within a very short time you have ruined the trust and thus the dream of many people of their own four walls. Now you, of all people, from the Union, who helped cause this whole disaster in the previous government, allegedly want to make the dream of your own four walls possible. It's nice that you obviously read the AfD application from 2018 and copied a lot of the right things from it. What you rejected then as a government, you now supposedly want to implement yourself. But their hypocrisy goes even further. Because of course it is right that the real estate transfer tax, as we have been demanding for years, must be reduced, especially for young families; but it was you from the Union who kept driving up the real estate transfer tax. The Union-led government under Helmut Kohl increased the real estate transfer tax from 2 percent to 3.5 percent in 1997. It was the Union-led government under Angela Merkel that made it possible for the federal states in 2006 to further increase property taxes independently. And of course the increases came immediately. What is particularly embarrassing - I have to say - for your application is that the CDU-governed states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein currently have the highest real estate transfer tax rate in Germany, namely 6.5 percent. So if you really wanted to relieve people, you would have had 16 years to do it - 16 years of doing nothing. In the countries you govern, you could still act immediately and lower the real estate transfer tax to 3.5 percent. The fact that you don't do this shows that your application is nothing more than a cheap window application without any substance. The Deutsche Bundesbank states that the biggest obstacle to owning your own four walls is the high real estate transfer tax in Germany. The level of this is the direct result of the Union's policy in recent years. So the CDU is the biggest obstacle to the dream of owning your own four walls here in Germany. This can also be seen very clearly in the housing construction costs. In the 16 years of Merkel, the costs of housing construction have exploded due to countless complicated building regulations and energy requirements: expensive heating systems, extreme heat-insulating glazing, dubious insulation regulations that have triggered a real insulation madness. Over 500 billion euros of Styrofoam was glued to German houses without it having any use, according to the German Economic Institute. If, in its application, the Union now allegedly wants to reduce the cost-driving requirements it has introduced itself, then that is nothing but sheer mockery. The fact is that a newly built square meter of living space in Germany today costs an average of 3400 euros and the whole thing leads to a rent of at least 13.50 euros. And 80 percent of the people in our country cannot afford that. It is therefore not without reason that Germany brings up the rear in Europe when it comes to home ownership. Deutsche Bundesbank clearly states that government housing policy is responsible for our home ownership rate being the lowest in all of Europe at just 45 percent, while the European average is well over 70 percent. We want to turn Germany from a country of tenants into a country of owners, and that's why we demand: First. All cost-driving building regulations must be reduced to a tolerable level and cost drivers eliminated. Second: the abolition of the property tax. That would be an immediate relief for every household in our country from 400 to 500 euros per year. Third: a general reduction in real estate transfer tax to 3.5 percent. Fourth: a complete real estate transfer tax exemption for the first self-used own four walls. Dear colleagues from the Union, it just makes a lot more sense to agree to the AfD's motions straight away, instead of first rejecting them and then bringing them back here as plagiarism. Thank you very much. Coming back briefly to item 27 on the agenda. Time for the roll-call vote is almost over. I would therefore like to ask: is there a Member of the House who has not yet voted? - This is the case. Then we'll wait a little longer. In the meantime, I'll call the next speaker: for the Bündnis 90/Die Grünen parliamentary group, Dr. Sandra Detzer.\n"

      "Dear Madam President! Madam Minister! Dear colleagues! Mr Leye, I'm pretty sure that the Union isn't doing a grand ballet when it comes to the annual economic report, trampling clumsily through the room. And that's the point. Yes, millions of people dream of owning their own property. That is a living promise of advancement. It's a lifetime achievement. Home ownership creates security, it protects against poverty in old age, not only for the generation that has reached it, but also for generations beyond. Another important piece of information for the more left-leaning part of this plenum: home ownership closes a gap in the distribution of wealth. That's social justice. That is why for us Free Democrats there is absolutely no question: we want to make Germany an owner nation. But on the way there - one has to realize that - there is still a lot to do. Mr. Luczak, you know that the home ownership rate in Germany is stagnating and, despite the Baukindergeld you celebrated, it has recently fallen. At the same time, prices are rising and supply is falling at the same time. So there's a good reason you're addressing home ownership; because there are great wishes here, but also some problems. I think it's really impressive that you're doing this, even though you know that we'll also talk about all the things you haven't done in the last 16 years. It's almost a selfless move. Who actually stopped you from expanding the KfW property promotion? We can do it with the SPD. Who stopped you from making the real estate transfer tax exemptions? We can do that with our coalition partners. But then you have to be honest: When we talk about home ownership - and it's important that we address it - then we have to say why Germany is where it is, and then you have to say: Your application helps when dealing with the past, but not when looking to the future. But I have to take out two points separately because they shocked me a bit. You have your own interpretation of the real estate transfer tax allowance: EUR 250,000 for each adult, EUR 150,000 for each child, almost EUR 1 million real estate transfer tax exemption for a family of four. Do you seriously believe that one of your prime ministers - Mr. Wüst or Mr. Söder - will even come close to enough real estate transfer tax exemption of EUR 1 million? This is a window joke like no other. I think it's indecent - I don't know how you get that - that you insinuate that we don't keep the promises we've made, that the child allowance that has been granted is insecure. Not only do I find that pathetic, I find it unspeakable. Of course, the German state adheres to the treaties that it has concluded. The only thing that came as a surprise was the complete shutdown of KfW, which you triggered. I have to admit that we didn't really manage the KfW subsidy in the first few months in the best possible way. – Yes, in contrast to the Union, self-awareness helps us to get better. You looked at everything for 16 years, didn't do anything and now you're here and making big speeches. Yes, the first quarter of the KfW funding was not ideal, but the program is now up and running and the preparatory work for a new program that focuses on the amount of CO2 saved, that is open to technology and takes people with it, is underway. That will come, and then we will also resolve the conflicting objectives of CO2 reduction in existing housing, unaffordable living space. We will set up a completely new funding system for this. This is how you move the country forward. I come back once more to the property. It is really important – thank you for putting it, Minister – that we approach the construction costs. What we have seen in recent months - it's not even years - in terms of building costs and building prices is absurd. That's why it's urgent - I also expect this from the Ministry of Building, from the BMWSB, because just being there has to make a difference - that we tackle the construction costs. We need the construction cost TÜV. We have to digitize: from planning to approval to execution. We have to clear out everything that slows us down. Time is money. speed helps. There's a lot to do. That's what the Free Democrats in this government will push. But now we will first - last sentence, Madam President - start with the big hurdle of equity on the way to ownership. Many families manage to some extent with the interest payments and the principal payments. But equity is a problem. That's why we're working on equity-replacing loans, as stated in the coalition agreement. But now really the last sentence. And we are working on the real estate transfer tax exemption. If you are serious about promoting home ownership, then start now To convince their countries that they go along with the real estate transfer tax, because without the countries the dream of owning a home is nothing. Many Thanks. That was a relatively large number of last sentences, but it was still within reason.\n",
      "13  \n",
      "Madam President! Dear Colleagues! The CDU/CSU often says that we shouldn't distance ourselves from the fact that we governed together for 16 years. I don't even want to do that; However, I want to use a few examples to make it clear where there are differences. Let's start with the minister. Uli Lange tweeted the day before yesterday: \"Has anyone seen Minister of Construction Geywitz?\" Well, today she is on the government bench. Yesterday she was at Construction Industry Day. The day before yesterday I met her at the Federal Chamber of Engineers. I could continue: with the tenants' associations, with the housing industry. This minister seeks dialogue, sets her own accents and motivates. This is one of the differences from its predecessor. I think it was a kind of phantom of building policy. At least he wasn't seen. The second difference. Her application is entitled \"Realize the dream of owning your own four walls\". It's about ownership. That's fine. Mr. Luczak, Romania has the highest ownership rate, Switzerland, I think, the lowest. It's open to debate, but you know very well that quotas alone aren't enough. The point is that we not only take care of those who want to create property - you want that, we want that too - but also take care of creating affordable housing for everyone. This is the second difference from the past. For you, tenants are the beneficiaries of ownership, as a seep effect, so to speak. But that doesn't live up to the challenge today; I say that clearly. Third point. We helped to pay for the child support. I have sometimes defended it more than people of yours; ask Kai Wegner. We also wanted to do something for the formation of property in the cities - buying cooperative shares - so that people can also afford to live in the city. That failed - not because of the SPD, not because of the BMF - at Haus Seehofer. It will be included in the current budget. It starts with 6 million euros: purchase of cooperative shares, promotion of ownership. Do you agree! Fourth point: KfW funding. Yes, this is a complicated subject. Daniel Föst said something critical, including self-critical, about this. But I will say one thing: the announcement triggered a flood of applications; this is true. It was Peter Altmaier's announcement. Apart from that, I want to remind you again what should have been done. There were 86,000 subsidized housing units in 2019, 197,000 subsidized housing units in 2020, and 362,000 subsidized housing units in 2021 - and that with a program that starts at €5 billion and ends at €16 billion. As a person responsible, you could get the idea that you have to control something. Who was responsible? – Exactly: Horst was responsible and Peter was responsible. And what did the two do, against the warnings from the BMF? - They didn't do anything. That, my dear colleagues, is not the point of such a program, a market launch program that then has to be designed on a degressive basis. Even Mr. Merz will agree with me; I am convinced of that. The purpose of the subsidy was primarily a climate policy and a technological one and not simply the uncontrolled promotion of property up to the penthouse. That wasn't the point. The fact that the follow-up funding - you complained - was gone in three hours is not a sign of caution. That's a sign that there is acceptance and effectiveness, that there is a willingness to promote climate policy for new construction. We must continue this. We presented that in the new funding and you are missing that. I come back to property promotion. The amount of the real estate transfer tax could simply be lowered in the countries. That doesn't happen in your countries any more than in the others. However, you could do it. I want to say something about that - Daniel Föst picked it up -: What you are talking about accounts for 8 billion euros less revenue for the federal states every year. I'm curious to see whether you get the placet of your prime minister. By the way: The federal states use the real estate transfer tax revenue to support and promote ownership measures in the federal states. Maybe you don't want that anymore; can be. So we have now focused on that and combined it with counter-financing. In terms of share deals, we not only want the small ones to be relieved, but also the big ones to be burdened. They also want to relieve the little ones, but at the same time burden the general public and let the big ones run free. We don't want that; that's another difference. Many of your demands, which are in the paper, are contained in our coalition agreement. I'm not on number \"16 years\", but ask for Sorry that not everything has been processed and implemented in 150 days. I freely admit that. That's so. One after the other; but we're doing it. We will also look at index rents so that the small property that people have does not eat up even more disposable income. I haven't seen any suggestion from you about this. There is no more time to be able to go into all tax measures. I would like to do that, but it doesn't work anymore. But I want to mention two more points that you forgot: First. You haven't said anything about the biggest roadblock to property formation, and that's skyrocketing land prices. Nothing comes from you. Secondly. We triple the funds for social housing promotion. In the federal states, social housing promotion contributes to a third of owner-occupied housing; out of 30,000 funded units, that accounts for 11,000. Please come to the end, sir. You obviously don't want that in this form either. I'll tell you: you in the opposition have not yet arrived at the renewal process. That's why we do the renewals. Thank you very much. Next, the word for Bündnis 90/Die Grünen was given to colleague Kassem Taher Saleh.\n"

      "Madam President! Dear Union, you pulled out a couple of verbal sledgehammers. At the end of the debate I would like to classify them again. First of all, you misquoted the Minister extremely wrongly, so wrongly that it is simply untrue. Minister Geywitz said quite rightly that not every generation can use up enough space to build their own homes, but that the old ones have to be renovated. We finally have guests here again and aren't just debating among ourselves. The young people from the schools sitting here have a right to think about what they are doing with their space. But that won't work if we've built over Germany. Ms. König, when 1 billion euros is gone in three hours, that shows that it was a relatively successful funding program. This shows how incredibly well and efficiently our construction industry can create living space. I think it's very important that we use the billions to set up new funding. Would you allow an interim question from the CDU/CSU parliamentary group? From Mr. Luczak? - Yes. Thank you, Madam, for allowing the interposed question. – You just referred to the fact that the construction industry is so good at handling the program. If you would allow me, I would briefly quote you a press release from the GdW. As is well known, the GdW is the association that - from your point of view - represents the good, socially positioned housing companies. I want to show you the quote. There it is formulated: It is more urgent than ever to end the subsidy chaos in climate-friendly, affordable construction. The ability to plan is a basic requirement for the creation of new living space. An effective and reliable funding system is urgently needed for this. The fiasco surrounding the KfW funding has already caused delays of up to 12 months in construction and modernization that can no longer be made up for. When you hear something like that, you notice a certain contradiction to what you say, that the construction industry can deal with it so well. It is true that we are currently very cautious that two thirds of the projects are currently being postponed because nobody knows exactly what the funding conditions will actually be from January 1, 2023. I would be interested to know how you actually want to resolve this contradiction. First of all: I differentiate between the construction and housing industries. It is totally possible to build climate-efficiently according to the KfW‑40 standard. The problem addressed next is there; this is true. The GdW addresses something that is completely true. But we didn't cause the funding chaos. I've just started making housing and construction policy here in the Bundestag, and the first thing I did was an incredible crisis communication, because over 10 billion euros were put into a completely overfunded program and we simply as budget donors - this Parliament decides the household - had no more money. When Minister Altmaier was still in power - as my colleagues have said several times - he stopped this funding program. It no longer had any control effect. It took a lot of tax money. And it certainly hasn't had the effect of encouraging home construction -- now and then, certainly. But it has been a subsidy for the housing industry. That's fine. But you misappropriated the federal funding for efficient buildings, Dr. Luczak. - We do that too. I believe that all the previous speakers in the traffic light coalition have already said: building ownership is important to us. However, we will have to put funding on a completely new footing one day; because what we have inherited from you is simply not enough. We want to stick to the 1.5 degree target. We owe that to the generation sitting up there. Because climate change is threatening the dream of owning your own home. Everyone who was affected by last year's severe flooding in Rhineland-Palatinate or North Rhine-Westphalia knows that. They have lost their homes, their memories, their pension schemes due to climate change. That is why it is important that federal funding for efficient buildings promotes efficient buildings in the future and not just new construction, keyword \"refurbishment\". And it's good that we're doing this now. We are reorganizing the federal funding for efficient buildings, we are making guidelines for the funding of pilot projects for serial renovation, we are making federal funding for efficient heating networks, we are making a law on municipal heat planning, we are making an expansion program and a qualification offensive for heat pumps, and then does this also work with climate-friendly living. This is not only important for reasons of affordability. That's also important, because we're having a have great geopolitical dependence. Warnings about skyrocketing gas prices were repeatedly issued. There have been repeated warnings about the high dependency on Putin's gas in residential areas. Thanks to your inaction, we will permanently break the climate targets by 2030, even if we now put all the resources we have into promoting the efficiency of buildings. We want to promote ownership; that is important to us. I think it's very, very good that the Minister of Finance is currently negotiating with the federal states regarding the real estate transfer tax. And: We want to set up a new equity promotion and the cooperative program. I believe that we have already laid the first foundation stones. What we need to do is bring land prices down; because these make housing extremely expensive in addition to inflation and a lack of building materials. We need to stop share deals and we need to empower communities to stockpile land. We need to take a look at the brokerage fee. In other countries it is 2 percent, and the rule is: whoever orders, pays. - In Germany it has increased since the law was passed by the GroKo 2020: from 6 to a good 7 percent. You have to imagine that: That's 30,000 euros at the usual purchase price. This is beautiful equity. We urgently need to regulate here. Dear Union, we are now making sure that climate-friendly housing works, we are now making sure that the promotion of property works, and we are now making sure that energy prices fall. I think we have a good program that we will work through together. Many Thanks. Many Thanks. – Colleague Ulrich Lange follows for the CDU/CSU.\n",

      "Dear Madam President! Dear Colleagues! Imagine sitting with your family at the breakfast table on a lazy Saturday morning in Kiryat Shmona, Israel, or in Kiryat Bialik, my twin town of Chemnitz, not far from the border with Lebanon. Suddenly, a bomb explodes in the immediate vicinity of your house or apartment. If you're lucky, you'll get away with it, if not, people you love, or maybe even yourself, will lose their life, health, or property. Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately this is everyday life in the only democracy in the Middle East. According to information from military experts, Hezbollah - Minister of State Lindner mentioned it - has stationed up to 150,000 rockets and over 50,000 fighters - a not inconsiderable proportion of them in southern Lebanon - and terrorizes the people in Israel wherever possible, but unfortunately also the own population in Lebanon, whose situation - we have heard this often today - is currently catastrophic. In the last year alone, three rockets were fired at Israel from southern Lebanon on May 13, six rockets on May 17, four rockets on May 19, two rockets on July 20, and two rockets on August 4. The most recent shelling was on April 25 this year. A few weeks ago, on the border with Lebanon, I had the opportunity to see in person the IDF-discovered terror tunnels that Hezbollah dug under the Lebanese-Israeli border to use their deadly weapons against people who, like all of us, live in freedom and democracy live, use. I don't think any of us here in the house or in the stands want to experience how in the middle of a children's birthday party, while the children are playing badminton, a fighter suddenly emerges from a terror tunnel onto the meadow. Ladies and gentlemen, we must end this terror. However, Hezbollah, which is largely financed by Iran, is not only a threat to Israel, but also a threat to the Lebanese population, whose situation is truly catastrophic. We all still remember the massive explosion and brutal destruction in the port of the Lebanese capital Beirut on August 4, 2020, when 2800 tons of ammonium nitrate detonated in a secret Hezbollah ammunition storage facility. 200 innocent people died and around 300,000 Lebanese people were left homeless. It cannot be surpassed in terms of perversion that Hezbollah, like the Palestinian Hamas, places such ammunition depots in residential areas and thus misuses the residents as living shields for their terror. One only has to listen to long-time Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, who openly said: The Zionist entity is to be temporary and in decline. - This means that Hezbollah, as Iran's proxy, has only one goal: the annihilation of the State of Israel. Ladies and gentlemen, for a country like Germany, in which human rights are very important and whose reason of state is the existence and security of Israel, this behavior is completely unacceptable. That is why the region needs the UNIFIL mandate - I fully agree with the previous speakers, especially Minister of State Lindner - more than ever. Because the tasks of UNIFIL are also the identification and elimination of such terror tunnels. For this reason, we Free Democrats will vote to extend the mandate. UNIFIL is undoubtedly one of the oldest UN missions and - as has been said several times - a very constant mediator between the Israeli and Lebanese sides. Against this background, the continued participation of armed German forces in UNIFIL is an enormously important contribution to reducing the threat to Israel, but also the suffering of the people in Lebanon and to ensuring stability in southern Lebanon. At this point, I would like to express my special thanks to Flotilla Admiral Mügge and all soldiers as well as the numerous civilian forces on site. The explosion in Ain Qana impressively shows that the cooperation did not only run smoothly; Minister of State Lindner said so. Therefore, the new government in Lebanon has an enormously important role, which must allow UNIFIL unrestricted access to all areas in southern Lebanon. UNIFIL not only helps prevent arms smuggling at sea, but is also an incredibly important humanitarian effort to secure transportation routes. The long-term goal in the interests of the people of Lebanon and the people of Israel must be to disarm the terrorist organization Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and hand back control to the Lebanese army in order to stabilize southern Lebanon. Because if Israel's security is Germany's reason of state and Human rights apply worldwide, then the UNIFIL mission is part of Germany's responsibility. That was true in the past and it will also be true in the future. I am therefore pleased that this mandate has been approved. Many Thanks.\n"

      "Dear Madam President! Dear Sir or Madam! Dear Colleagues! Dear Mr. Hunko, even if I am running out of my speaking time, I would still like to say: yesterday evening I spoke with high-ranking representatives of Ukraine, and the international world and security order was also an issue. We have a change in our security regime; I will come back to that in my speech. It is only good, wise and right that we participate in these mandates and maintain these three mandates. That became clear again in the conversation last night. Everything has it's time. After Russia's brutal and despicable war of aggression against Ukraine, which changed our global security order, we must now face the changed foreign and security policy challenges. This also includes UNIFIL. So today we are talking about Lebanon. It has been a hotbed of conflict and war for decades, and a place of untold suffering for Lebanese civilians and 1.5 million refugees. It is a tragedy what has become of this country that was once the green pearl of the Orient, that was once a model of reconciliation between religions and communities in the Middle East. The small Mediterranean country is currently experiencing serious crises again: economically, socially and politically. The currency is falling, and the country has been hit hard by the grain delivery failures from Ukraine. A catastrophe is imminent. Added to this is the fact that the past elections have produced no real victors, and once again there is a threat of an incapable government. Even if the task seems difficult to solve, we must not abandon the people there. It is therefore good, wise, right and important that this federal government speaks out in favor of the continuation of the UNIFIL mandate. Incidents keep happening along the Blue Line, the demarcation line. The unresolved issues related to the sea border between Israel and Lebanon still harbor the potential for conflict. Germany remains interested in promoting lasting peace and stability in the Middle East. Lebanon and Israel - both - also attach great importance to the presence of the United Nations and German participation in UNIFIL. Thus, the contribution of the UN UNIFIL Peace Commission remains essential to de-escalating tension and achieving lasting stability in Lebanon. Germany is currently involved with 62 soldiers. Dear colleagues, at this point, here and now, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the soldiers who are making a major and indispensable contribution to peace in this crisis-torn region. What is UNIFIL about? First. It is about the function of UNIFIL as a de-escalation and communication channel, to reduce tensions through diplomacy and mediation, specifically on the ground at the Blue Line and in particular in the so-called tripartite talks with the Lebanese and Israeli armed forces. We must not forget that the state of war between Israel and Lebanon has not yet officially ended. Furthermore, both states do not recognize each other. Land and sea borders are not defined. But both accept and protect the valuable UNIFIL dispute resolution mechanism. They only exchange ideas directly under the umbrella of the United Nations. So both Lebanon and Israel have a great interest in the presence of the United Nations and German participation. Secondly. But it is also about preventing arms smuggling from the sea. This helps prevent the arming of groups such as Hezbollah, which threaten Lebanon's stability and Israel's security. This contribution at sea against arms smuggling into Lebanon has two components: On the one hand, the maritime UNIFIL component secures the sea side. Only a few cases of arms smuggling across the sea are recorded; this also shows the effectiveness of this application. On the other hand, we are making a contribution to the Lebanese Navy being able to take over border security at sea itself in the long term. Third. The German government is pursuing a networked approach in Lebanon that combines foreign, security and development policy instruments. Lebanon alone has taken in 1.5 million refugees from Syria. With a population of just 6 million in Lebanon, this is a remarkable and tremendous achievement that deserves our respect. Ladies and gentlemen, with every mandate that has been submitted for approval here in this House, we have to weigh up the risks and the responsibility. The deliberations on the UNIFIL mandate are starting now. We, the SPD parliamentary group, are firmly convinced that it is the right and sensible decision to continue to support this UN mandate, this UN mission, and to extend it until June 30, 2023. I hope that this House will accept our international responsibility with a large majority. Dear Mr. Wundrak, that is a responsibility - colleague Larem, please come to the end. – which your group probably does not have. Thank you very much.\n",

      "Dear Madam President! Ladies and gentlemen! The UNIFIL mandate has already been correctly described in all speeches. It is particularly important to us, as the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, to point out that we only make a small contribution as part of the MTF, i.e. maritime support, but the mandate is much larger. We as the Bundeswehr are on site together with the nations involved, at the express request of the Israelis and at the express request of Lebanon, so that compliance with the ceasefire agreement is monitored locally. In general, this works very well, also in international cooperation. That is why the mandate is still useful and necessary. Contrary to what my colleague Wundrak said here for the AfD parliamentary group, I have to say: I also consider this to be a core task of the Bundeswehr, the German Navy and also our parliament. It's not just about strengthening the national and alliance defense on our own sovereign territory - as the AfD repeatedly claims - but it's about that we also assume our international responsibility where there is war, where people are dying, where there is torture and oppression and where we can contribute to stability. The Bundeswehr does this on our behalf. We are proud of that, ladies and gentlemen. Contrary to what the AfD has claimed, the job is not over either. Since the beginning of my political activity, I have experienced right-wing extremist parties with very different names and heads. But I would also never claim that we are done with the fight against right-wing extremism in Germany just because the AfD partially disappears from the state parliaments. The task will only be complete when there is peace and stability, when it is ensured locally that the tasks of the coast guard can be carried out by Lebanon itself in the future. If there is stability on site, then the mandate and the task are fulfilled, but not if the AfD claims that here in Parliament, ladies and gentlemen. The task must also continue because, according to the admiral, who is now in charge of military leadership, the task has not yet been completed. The Lebanese are not yet in a position to carry out coastal protection tasks independently. This is partly due to the lack of material skills. The Inspector General of the German Armed Forces recently demanded that the local coast guard be reinforced with modern patrol boats; We will hopefully talk about this as part of the upgrading initiative. But even the training has not yet reached the stage where the tasks can be carried out by and by the Lebanese themselves. Ladies and gentlemen, we are still needed on site to continue this mission. I am very glad that the parliamentary center of this House has always supported this mission in recent years, regardless of their role, whether in government or in the opposition. – Also not independent of the situation. If you read the respective assignments, then you will already see that the situation update has changed, that we have made great progress on the ground, which we would never have made if we had followed your political ideologies and had broken off the mission, I think so dear ladies and gentlemen. The arguments from the two blocs on the left and right in the extremes of this Parliament are changing, as to why the operation should be stopped. The truth is: As a left-winger, you are against any deployment of the Bundeswehr abroad. They want to abolish NATO. You want to establish a new military and security alliance with Russia - if what is in your election manifesto is still relevant; maybe it's a bit outdated. They actually don't want any Bundeswehr and no deployments. But then don't keep inventing new reasons why you're against the missions! You are against these missions because you are against the Bundeswehr, ladies and gentlemen, and then you have to represent that openly here in Parliament. The AfD is a little different. They are also against the stakes, for different reasons. I deliberately watched the last parliamentary debates again in preparation for today's debate: Depending on the speaker, you are sometimes against, sometimes for, for very different reasons. So I just want to say that you are right when you say that no weapons and drugs that reached Lebanon by sea were found. But that's the success of the mission - nothing to find. It is the task of this mission to ensure security through a high density of controls in such a way that that in the end no weapons and drugs can be smuggled. I want to close, ladies and gentlemen, with a report that Lieutenant Commander Pascal Störk gave after the return of the sloop “Braunschweig”. He said: If you take into account the two-week quarantine before the start of the mission, we were on the road for 160 days and could only be on our less than 90 meter long corvette during the mission. I think our soldiers are doing a tremendous job on the ground. Madam President, I am closing. I don't even want to imagine what would happen if the AfD faction, which is about the size of this troop unit, were locked up alone on a 90 meter long ship for 160 days - definitely not a successful mission. Many Thanks. Lamya Kaddor now has the floor for the Bündnis 90/Die Grünen parliamentary group.\n"

      "Madam President! Dear Colleagues! The impetus given here with the motion is correct; because I think it goes against our sense of justice and solidarity when extra profits are made through wars or crises, so to speak. Secondly. The tasks of the state almost always increase in such situations. I believe that it is also justified to ask the question of the ability to finance the state's performance, especially if one feels committed to a debt brake. So the momentum is good. But I also want to say: I'm experiencing a little déjà vu. Because I spoke about exactly this motion here a year ago. A year ago, the same motion was called: \"Skimming off the extra profits from crisis winners like Amazon\". It was basically the same motion with a different title. It was also about the excess profit tax at the time, but only for digital companies. Now the old application has been warmed up with copy and paste, so to speak. In a way, one word has been replaced by the other. I have to say that, in my opinion, this is a rather unfortunate course of action. Because it actually hurts those who have a certain sympathy for the concept of excess profits tax if you apply it from case to case. Everyone has to worry: once they are economically successful, they are threatened with, boom, something like that. So it's a difficult story. – No, I definitely have sympathy for it. – But I want to say: there are a number of delimitation problems that have to be taken into account. This was also shown by the expert opinion of the scientific service. The reasons for the emergence of an excess profit can be very different. They can be achieved, so to speak, simply without any effort on your part. They can be achieved through innovation. And there are problems with reference values, with offsetting, for example. This is a special debate that we probably cannot have at this point for reasons of time. We should continue. But what is the alternative to do now? Fortunately, it is already the case today that higher profits initially result in higher tax payments from companies. I have a practical example: the city of Mainz was able to offset its high level of debt to a certain extent by exorbitantly increasing trade tax payments. That's certainly good. But we still have an additional problem, namely the design of tax loopholes, if I may put it that way, and international design. The minimum taxation at international level for multinational digital corporations is therefore also a correct and important step. I would also like to point out that we have of course laid down certain points in the coalition agreement, for example to thoroughly review and actually question the tax subsidies in the energy sector. I believe that it is precisely in this area that energy companies benefit from tax breaks to a considerable extent. In my opinion, it is correct that we as the SPD in the last grand coalition withstood the pressure - also from the Union - and did not extend the so-called energy peak compensation across the board and unchecked for all sectors. After all, there are over 9000 companies, and there are also many from the energy sector. Such relief, exceptions and such support are also appropriate for companies in the manufacturing industry that are in international competition and need relief, especially in the current situation. But we simply have to eliminate the deadweight effects for corporations that are not subject to any carbon leakage risk at all. The system of tax breaks in the energy and electricity sector is no longer up to date and needs to be reviewed. I think overall we need to do three things at this point. First: diversification of our energy supply, our energy sources. This is emphasized here in almost every session and in every speech; I don't have to go into that any further. Second: Relief for citizens. The justification has just been addressed by Mr Görke. Until the EEG surcharge is abolished, the packages will cost 35 billion euros. I keep saying that because it shouldn't be underestimated. Third: strengthening competition. That is why it is right to take antitrust and competition law measures so that the markets work. It is correct that we have the requirements within the framework of the GWB - - Mr Daldrup, you can continue speaking, quickly or slowly, but you are now doing it at the expense of your colleagues. I'll stop now. – I must briefly refer to the GWB. I think the special debate is to continue and I hope that we can do it constructively. Thank you very much. For the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, Dr. Michael master the word.\n",
      "9  \n",
      "Madam President! Dear Colleagues! The left-wing faction, Mr. Görke, has submitted an application for the introduction of profit taxes on crisis profits from energy companies. This follows the basic idea that one should redistribute in this country. Mr Daldrup just spoke of sympathy. I have sympathies for the social market economy. The basic idea of ​​the social market economy is not redistribution, but the basic idea of ​​the social market economy is freedom, property, competition, solidarity and subsidiarity. And I have a lot of sympathy for these principles. These principles have given our country the prosperity we have today over the past 70 years, and we should not destroy it. Secondly. All profits in this country are taxed according to the tax base. So even what you want to tax as excess profit is already taxed under the rules that we have. What you are asking for is a second taxation. Then I think it's great when you say: Companies with high profits - they have already contributed a large share to the tax revenue - should pay that, and then do so when they have 10 million euros more income than in the previous year. - Now take a small start-up that just got out of the red, is now in the profit zone, surpassing 10 million. That then pays your excess profit tax. And the billion-dollar corporation that has managed to generate billions in earnings, but at about the same level as in the previous year, does not pay the excess profit tax. What you are proposing here is absolute nonsense: punish the small and the big don't have to pay! Actually, I've always heard the opposite from you: you want to get to the big ones. – Therefore, it is an absolute unequal treatment of profits; It doesn't depend on the profit and the origin of the profit, but on the previous year, which actually has nothing to do with the matter at all. In our market economy we set completely wrong incentives. We have a Federal Minister of Economics, Ms. Brantner, who is currently traveling the world trying to bring goods to Germany that have become scarce due to Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine. I give gas and oil as examples; one could continue the list indefinitely. At the same time, we are now saying: We want to tax those who supply us with such goods particularly heavily. – Do you think that bringing such goods here will help Herr Habeck on his advertising tour of the world? No, with the idea we will contribute to a shortage of goods that are already in short supply. This is not in the interest of our country and the people who live here. Dear colleague Daldrup, you just mentioned BioNTech based in Mainz. This is a great story for all of us, not only because of the tax revenue but also because we got a vaccine. BioNTech is a startup that suddenly shot up and is now producing excess profit - not in the energy space, but that's not the point right now. The point is, your excess profit tax is penalizing innovation in this country. You punish those who innovate. We must reward innovation in this country, not penalize it. Dear friends, you have problems with demarcation: What is actually an excess profit? They make it easy for themselves and say: If it's 10 million euros more than in the previous year. – In my view, that is a rather nonsensical definition. Then you're talking about crisis-related profits. Where in the definition is it asked whether the profit is due to the crisis or has other reasons? It's very clear: We have clever tax advisors in this country. They will, of course, ensure that you stay within the volatility and don't pay the tax by accruing and timing when you allow profits to accrue. So this is an incentive for tax planning. I believe innovation should be business driven, not tax driven. A note at the end. You say: The United States of America had already introduced such a tax. – The United States of America had an excess profits tax exactly twice: after entering World War I and during World War II. The reasoning was: In order to finance the high costs of the wars, an excess profit tax was introduced. – Now I say: Take a look at the tax estimate for the Federal Republic of Germany from last week. According to the current tax estimate, we can expect additional revenue of 220 billion euros by 2026. Do we have a situation in which we have to finance high war costs and - as a result - tax losses? I say no. That's why your comparison with the US is here completely out of place. We will not agree to this request. Many Thanks.

      "Madam President! Dear Colleagues! Dear guests here in the house! Thank you for this request. Very high profits from mineral oil and energy companies have been discussed for several weeks. The government is currently also examining this under antitrust law, and we are also discussing whether taxation could make sense. I would like to bring some level-headedness and reflection to this heated debate. I would like to begin with my sincere appreciation for the social market economy that has given us the prosperity that we all enjoy today. It is clear: we must now develop it into a social-ecological market economy; because the planetary boundaries are simply a fact. If we don't respect them, we lose any basis for our business. However, the core of this term is the word “market economy”. Well-functioning markets have many market participants. They enable the free exchange of goods, innovations, the generation of ideas, and ultimately the joy of experimenting and shaping the future. In order for them to work, they need a few framework conditions that prevent things from being too anarchic and from allowing fair competition. Sales and profits are a natural part of this market economy; we can take it easy. As an entrepreneur and founder, this point is really important to me. Sales and profits can and should of course be positive. Who wouldn't begrudge it to the bakery, bookstore or butcher around the corner. Scaling small and large companies should and are allowed to do so in our market economy. It is precisely the innovative forces that allocate resources well and that we also need for the future viability of our continent. Good markets regulate and also ensure a good price, a market price that creates an economic optimum through supply and demand. However, what we are currently seeing at gas stations and on electricity bills is anything but optimal. Rather, we have oligopolistic market structures in the mineral oil sector; this is undisputed everywhere. However, such structures prevent the actually positive power of markets. These dysfunctional markets are then no longer free or fair in the sense of a market economy; because a few companies can exploit their market power and enforce exorbitant prices. That's what we're very likely seeing in the oil space right now. Take diesel as an example: While the price of crude oil rose by around 20 cents per liter in March compared to January due to the Ukraine war, the prices at gas stations rose by an average of around 48 cents, i.e. by two and a half times as much. And this difference remains - that's simply a fact - according to the current state of knowledge as an additional profit for the companies and adds up for diesel and petrol together to around 1.2 billion euros for the month of March alone. Are these also excess profits? You have to ask yourself that honestly. This is crucial. From what we now know, the cost structures have essentially remained the same, but the risks have increased. That said, taking a serve is perfectly legitimate. But that high? Two and a half times as much? Even if we say that 10 percent risk premium is okay in normal times, then the remaining 90 percent is excess profits, i.e. a little more than 1 billion euros, and that in just one month. Although no current quarterly figures are available for German companies, the international figures unfortunately show that this is structural. The situation in the energy sector is similar to that in the mineral oil sector, and this also applies to listed companies in Germany. The free pricing market is disrupted in the energy sector. It doesn't work. Unfortunately, this has to be said with such clarity. The social context is important. Because while on the one hand we are obviously seeing strong excess profits at a few companies - this is currently being examined - the price hikes of energy companies seem to be fueling inflation strongly. We talked extensively about inflation last week and again yesterday. It remains a huge problem that consumer prices are going through the roof like this. This is particularly evident in the case of food, which - we always talk about supply chains - is also very heavily dependent on energy costs. According to the German Brewers' Association - I think this is of interest to some here in this group - there is even a risk of a shortage of bottled beer in summer because many breweries can no longer afford the increased costs due to energy-intensive bottle production. One thing is clear: This abuse of market power and the emergence of dysfunctional markets must be prevented, and not just because of bottled beer. When individuals profit excessively and the market does not ensures an appropriate balance, then the state - I'm using an outdated term here - has to intervene as a night watchman, so to speak. Balancing is one of his tasks. Other European countries such as Italy or Greece as well as the OECD also support the idea of ​​the so-called windfall profits taxation. That is why we must continue to discuss this issue with one another, but rather as an instrument of antitrust market control. The excess profit tax, if we want to call it that, would not only contribute to fair redistribution and relieve the budget, but at the same time it would also send out an important signal towards the future. Excessive market power and dysfunctional markets and their effects are not free. Simply because of the presence of such a tax, because of the signal, price increases such as we are currently experiencing in the energy industry would possibly no longer occur in the future. That could be a really effective and forward-looking inflation hedge, I think. Let's discuss this further together. I'm looking forward to it. Many Thanks. Deputy Jan Schmidt has the floor for the AfD parliamentary group.\n"
